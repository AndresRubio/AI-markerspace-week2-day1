## Prototype LLM applications and deploy, monitor, and improve them in production!
In just 7-weeks, this adventure will take you on a journey with the AI Makerspace community from prototyping to production to Demo Day!

You will learn to prototype LLM applications first through prompt engineering, then layering in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning of both LLMs and embedding models. You will get many iterations of hands-on practice of deploying LLM web applications to a public URL with a slick user interface!

You will learn how to move from prototyping into production by applying RAG evaluation and improvement techniques, outfitting your applications with monitoring and visibility tooling, leveraging efficient inference and serving techniques, and deploying scalable endpoints.
